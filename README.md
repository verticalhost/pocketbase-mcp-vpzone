**Required:**
- `pocketbaseUrl`: Your PocketBase instance URL

**Optional:**
- `adminEmail`: Admin email for super admin authentication
- `adminPassword`: Admin password for elevated operations
- `debug`: Enable debug logging for troubleshooting

### Node.js Deployment
Required environment variables:
- `POCKETBASE_URL`: URL of your PocketBase instance (e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:8090")

Optional environment variables:
- `POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin email for certain operations
- `POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Admin password
- `POCKETBASE_DATA_DIR`: Custom data directory path

### Cloudflare Workers Deployment
Configure in `wrangler.toml` or through Cloudflare dashboard:

```toml
[env.production.vars]
POCKETBASE_URL = "https://your-pocketbase-instance.com"
POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"

[env.production.secrets]
POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD = "your-super-secure-password"
```

**Environment-specific considerations:**
- **Development**: Use local PocketBase instance with full admin access
- **Production**: Use hosted PocketBase with potential admin restrictions
- **Edge**: Cloudflare Workers provide global deployment with Durable Objects

### Production Security & Super Admin Authentication
- Admin credentials enable the `pocketbase_super_admin_auth` tool
- Production environments may restrict admin API access for security
- Use diagnostic tools (`analyze_pocketbase_capabilities`) to understand your deployment
- The super admin tool bypasses production restrictions when credentials are valid
